## The team
Since its inception, SKlauncher has been developed solely by **SKmedix**, who has served as the *primary developer*. In early 2023, **Foxer** joined the team as a *Front-End developer*.

Although the team is small, **the community** plays an invaluable role: users contribute by *translating the launcher*, *testing* and reporting bugs, *moderating* the Discord server, and providing *support* to fellow users.
