# Boost Your FPS on Low-End PCs

## Hey there!
If you’re using a low-end setup (like 4GB RAM, older CPUs, or integrated graphics), don’t worry — Minecraft can still run smoothly! This guide will help you optimize Minecraft for better performance on SKlauncher.

## Best JVM Settings
Use these JVM arguments for better performance:
```
-Xmx2G -Xms512M -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:G1NewSizePercent=20
