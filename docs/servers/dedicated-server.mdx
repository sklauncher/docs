1. No need to install Java!\
Since we're going to talk about commands or even create a .bat/.sh file to start the server, it would be convenient to use the extractable Java\
(otherwise, imagine the problem of installing a Java for SKlauncher and another Java for the server).

2. There isn't an official list to download the .jar for the server, but there's [MCVersions](https://mcversions.net/) as a possible option (since the URLs come from the official server).

> Want to set up a multiplayer server?
>
> Please note: This server setup is only compatible with Minecraft: Java Edition.
>
> If you want to run a Minecraft multiplayer server by yourself things get kind of involved (see [this wiki article for a tutorial](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server)). First make sure you can use java from the command line. On Linux and macOS this should already be set up but on Windows you might have to tinker with the PATH environment variable.
>
> Download [minecraft_server.jar](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) and run it with the following command:
>
> `java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui`
>
> Should you want to start the server with its graphical user interface you can leave out the "nogui" part.
>
> Just so you know, by downloading any of the software on this page, you agree to the [Minecraft End User License Agreement](https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula) and [Privacy Policy](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839).
>
> If you want to skip the setup and start exploring other 3rd party servers visit our official [Server Listing Site](http://aka.ms/verifiedservers). Each server offers its own brand of fun and uniqueness. Find your favorite with our Server List Site, where all listed servers have been reviewed and verified as following our community standards and guidelines. Browse servers based on game type, play style, and more. Chance is there’s a server listed for you – regardless of age or the way you play.
