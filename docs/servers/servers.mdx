:::tip

Looking for servers instead of creating them? Unfortunately there is no master server like in other games, so you must search for them yourself in places like:
- [Xyrios](https://xyrios.com/minecraft/servers) for Microsoft and Offline accounts (identified as Premium and Non-Premium respectively).
- [Official and verified list](https://aka.ms/verifiedservers) for Microsoft accounts.

:::

There are 2 ways to make a server in the game: the 1st one is to open in LAN your singleplayer world and the 2nd one is to create a dedicated server.\
Although the 1st option should be the easiest, they are still advanced topics. \*

<small>\* - If everything is ok, you just follow the guide and that's it! But problems can always occur, from properly allowing in the Firewall to talking to your ISP because you don't have a real Public IP.</small>
