Looking for servers instead of creating them?\
Currently there's no official\* server list globally, but you'll be able to find several in [Xyrios](https://xyrios.com/) when it's released to the public!

<small>\* - Ok, there's only the [official and verified list](http://aka.ms/verifiedservers) for Microsoft accounts. But there isn't a list of all servers for Microsoft and Offline accounts!</small>

:::

There are 2 ways to make a server in the game: the 1st one is to open in LAN your singleplayer world and the 2nd one is to create a dedicated server.\
Although the 1st option should be the easiest, they are still advanced topics. \*

<small>\* - If everything is ok, you just follow the guide and that's it! But problems can always occur, from properly allowing in the Firewall to talking to your ISP because you don't have a real Public IP.</small>
