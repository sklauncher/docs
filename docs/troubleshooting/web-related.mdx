Before you start looking here, check the following pages first:

## I forgot my password
1. Go to the SKlauncher website, click on *Sign in* and finally on *[Forgot password?](https://skmedix.pl/reset-password)*
2. Follow the on-screen instructions.

If your Discord account uses the same email as your SKlauncher account, you could click *Login with Discord*. This would be only for the remote case that you even forgot your email.

:::note

If you forgot your email address or lost access to it, it won't be possible to recover the account.\
I think in that case, it would be a good time to start researching and using *password managers* (Bitwarden, KeePass, etc.) to make sure this never happens to you again.
