## My problem doesn't appear!
1. You can always [join the Discord server](https://skmedix.pl/discord) and use the appropriate channels to ask a question. But before you do that, using the search option in Discord to find answers can save you unnecessary waiting time.
   - We only ask you to do 3 things:
     - Search if someone else asked the same problem and got a solution.
     - Explain properly what has happened.
     - Send the corresponding [logs](/faq/uncategorized#where-are-the-logs-located).
     - Finally wait patiently for an answer.
2. Search on the Internet because, unless it's a very specific problem about SKlauncher, you're likely to find answers to your problems much faster.
   - Officially there is [Minecraft Forum](https://www.minecraftforum.net/) and [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/).
   - You can also find much more information on [Google](https://www.google.com/) (or any other search engine) and/or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).
