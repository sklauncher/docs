## Error: Unable to access jarfile when opening SKlauncher
The path [where SKlauncher is installed](/faq/launcher-related#where-is-sklauncher-installed) contains special characters (like `?, !, ^, &, $`) or you put it in OneDrive.\
Or the file (SKlauncher.jar if that's the name) is not actually in the folder from which you run the command.

## Your username contains non-ASCII characters
This is a problem only on Windows as Linux and macOS do not allow you to create a user with anything other than A-Z and 0-9 (alphanumeric, no accents, commas, etc).

You have 2 possible options:\
\-A- [Install in another folder](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-install-sklauncher-in-another-folder), something simple like `C:\Games\SKlauncher`.\
\-B- Rename your user's folder, but it's advanced. Here is a guide for [Windows 10](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/89060-change-name-user-profile-folder-windows-10-a.html) / [Windows 11](https://www.elevenforum.com/t/change-name-of-user-profile-folder-in-windows-11.2133/).

## Connection problems
Maybe the website doesn't work for you, maybe you start the launcher but it says something like "Offline Mode - You're connected to the Internet" or it has some other error that seems related to the Internet connection.

These problems are complicated because they can be:\
\- You or your ISP's problem.\
\- SKlauncher's problem.\
\- External problem that none of you, your ISP or SKlauncher can solve.

:::tip

1. Close (or restart after doing a step) whatever is giving you connection error (browser / launcher / game).
2. Do one step at a time and in order!

:::

1. Make sure you have not blocked Java in your Firewall (like [Windows Firewall](https://www.howtogeek.com/242375/how-to-troubleshoot-minecraft-lan-game-problems/#i-can-t-see-the-minecraft-game-on-the-lan)), you might see it as Java or OpenJDK.
    - You can also delete everything related to Java / OpenJDK, so next time the Firewall prompts and you can click Allow.
2. Check in [Time.is](https://time.is/) that your time is synced, otherwise you will have to adjust it.
    - You can even change the NTP server by using [Google NTP](https://developers.google.com/time/guides), [Cloudflare NTP](https://developers.cloudflare.com/time-services/ntp/usage/) or [Pool NTP Project](https://www.ntppool.org/en/) and have your OS take care of keeping the time in sync (something that should be on default).
3. Restart the Router and even the PC.
4. Use [Google DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using) or [Cloudflare DNS](https://one.one.one.one/dns/), both links show you (scroll down) the IPv4 and IPv6 to use and even instructions on how to use them.
    - After changing the DNS, it would be convenient to do an `ipconfig /flushdns` or its equivalent in your OS (this command is for Windows via CMD / PowerShell).
5. Try using a VPN like [Cloudflare WARP](https://one.one.one.one/) or [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/), where you should choose (if it allows it) the nearest country to yours (you will have to test it, since you may choose one that blocks or is blocked by the services you want to use).

If after following each step and even step 6 is not a solution, it could be a problem where you can't do anything but wait.\

## Launcher starts but closes or keeps loading forever
1. Delete other launcher folders located in `.minecraft`
2. Delete `sklauncher` folder located in `.minecraft`
3. Delete `java` folder located in `%APPDATA%`
4. Check that Java is allowed in your Firewall and/or Antivirus.
5. Follow the [Installation](/getting-started/install) guide again and restart the PC.

## My skin hasn't changed
- If there are no problems with the server (like the overload that occurred in August 2021) or problems with your connection:
  - When you upload your skin/cape for the first time you should see the change instantly (if you already have the Launcher/Game open, you should close it).
  - But when you want to change your skin/cape for the second, third, etc. time it may take a couple of hours to change (and it's even possible that the Launcher shows your old skin but inside the Game you already see the new one).
- So if you saved the skin/cape [properly](/faq/web-related#how-do-i-put-on-a-skin-or-cape), you don't have much else to do but wait.

## My skin isn't visible on servers or with mods
- <u>Singleplayer</u>: If it works in Vanilla (no mods), then it could be a problem with the Mod Loader or one of the mods.
  - If it's a particular mod, you don't use it and done. But if it was the Mod Loader there is not much you can do (you could report it in [the Discord server](https://skmedix.pl/discord)).
- <u>Multiplayer</u>: Some servers have plugins to change the skin by typing `/skin MicrosoftUsername` in the chat (and even allow to put the url of the skin, but it depends on the plugin).

## I can't see any version in SKlauncher
Check if your [Launcher logs](/faq/launcher-related#where-are-the-logs-located) says anything about "DNS Poisoning", if it does you're in trouble:
1. Start a full system scan with your Antivirus, the stronger the scan the better. And waits for it to finish.
    - Hey! Maybe you don't have any virus and you know perfectly well that you ran something that was going to change what is mentioned in step 2.
2. Disconnect from Internet and open `%WINDIR%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file with Notepad. Delete unwanted DNS text lines without # at the beginning of the text lines (especially if they say something about Microsoft, Mojang, etc).
3. Run CMD as administrator and type `ipconfig /flushdns`. After that just restart your PC, reconnect to Internet and run SKlauncher.
    - If it still doesn't work delete .json files of the launcher and run again. If you've still questions and problems, head to our [Discord](https://skmedix.pl/discord).

## I can't allocate more than 1 GB
You must have x64 (64-bits) Java installed, read the [Install](/getting-started/install) guide.

## I can only play the Demo mode
If you haven't [forced the demo mode](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-force-the-demo-mode), then read the [Log in](/getting-started/login) guide again.

## 'X' client doesn't work
Edit the Client installation in the launcher and enable Compatibility Mode.

## Going into Friends tab on Hypixel hangs the game
Edit the installation you're using in the launcher and enable Compatibility Mode.
