## My question doesn't appear!
1. You can always [join the Discord server](https://skmedix.pl/discord) and use the appropriate channels (searching in the channels and/or using the search option may save you unnecessary waiting time).
   - We only ask you to do 3 things:
     - Search if someone else asked the same question and got an answer.
     - Formulate your question properly.
     - Finally wait patiently for an answer.
2. Search on the Internet because, unless it's a very specific question about SKlauncher, you're likely to find answers to your questions much faster.
   - Officially there is [Minecraft Forum](https://www.minecraftforum.net/) and [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki).
   - You can also find much more information on [Google](https://www.google.com/) (or any other search engine) and/or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/).

## Where are the logs located?
The logs about the launcher will always be [where you have .minecraft](/faq/launcher-related#where-is-sklauncher-installed), but the logs about the game will be [where you have your game directory](/faq/launcher-related#how-does-game-directory-work).

- Launcher: `.minecraft\sklauncher\sklauncher_logs.txt`
- Game: `.minecraft\logs\latest.log` and `.minecraft\crash-reports\crash-YYYY-MM-DD_HH.MM.SS-client.txt`

:::tip

You can copy the logs content and paste it in [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/), this way you send a link instead of a huge message.\
Or [upload the files](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/25444343291031-File-Attachments-FAQ#h_01J4M00QYZTXY5FV9KDWT05H5T) directly to Discord.

PS: It might be good to read what the launcher shows you, because if your game crashes and the launcher shows again telling you just that: at the top right you will have 2 buttons, where one of them is to give you the link to the report.

:::

### Debug mode
Sometimes you need the logs to show even more information to find the cause of the problem.

:::warning

You should do this only if requested to do it and after that revert the changes.

:::

Start the launcher and edit the installation you're having problems with.\
Then you must edit in the "More Options" section the following:\
\- Launcher Visibility: *Keep the launcher open and show game output*\
\- JVM Arguments: Add at the end `-Xdiag -Dsklauncher.debug=true` (remember there is space between arguments)

After that you start the game and you'll see the game console open and that's it. Reproduce again the problem you're having and send all the logs (copy and paste everything the console says might be necessary).

PS: If the problem is about the launcher and it doesn't generate logs, you could start it from your Terminal / CMD with `java -jar SKlauncher.jar`
