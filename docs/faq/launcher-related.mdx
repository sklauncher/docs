## Where is SKlauncher installed?
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\.minecraft`
- Linux: `~/.minecraft`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`

Copy that path according to your OS into the folder address bar to go to that location.

:::info

This is actually where Minecraft: Java Edition is ~~installed~~ downloaded. Since SKlauncher doesn't have an installer yet, it's just:\
\- `\java` (you may find it, but it's useless for you)\
\- `\.minecraft\sklauncher`\
\- `\.minecraft\sklauncher-fx.jar`\
\- *The SKlauncher.exe/.jar you downloaded*

:::

## Can I install SKlauncher in another folder?
Yes, just run it with `--workDir` but keep in mind that:
1. Use *absolute paths* because *relative paths* or *current directory* (".") may cause errors.
2. Everything that should go in *[.minecraft](#where-is-sklauncher-installed)* will now be in the workDir you set.
3. If you already had [game directories](#how-does-game-directory-work) defined, you'll have to change them to the new path.

### Windows
Create a shortcut and edit it to use this launch parameter or run it from the Terminal / CMD:
- Shortcut: Right click on SKlauncher.exe/.jar -> Create shortcut -> Right click on that new shortcut -> Properties -> General tab -> Target: and at the end add `--workDir "C:\Games\SKlauncher"` (like [this](https://i.imgur.com/T1HkqQc.png)).
- CMD: `SKlauncher.exe --workDir "C:\Games\SKlauncher"` or `java.exe -jar SKlauncher.jar --workDir "C:\Games\SKlauncher"`

### Linux / macOS
Run it from the Terminal: `java -jar SKlauncher.jar --workDir "~/Games/SKlauncher"`

## Difference between Microsoft and Offline?
Since that's already a bit explained by reading the [Log in](/getting-started/login) guide, let's talk about the key differences in a very simple and summarized way.

|                              |      Microsoft      |        SKlauncher       |        Offline       |
|:----------------------------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------:|
|       Change your skin       |         Yes         |           Yes           |          No          |
|       Change your cape       | Only if you won one |           Yes           |          No          |
| Visibility of your skin/cape |        Global       | SKlauncher players only |          No          |
|     Servers you can join     |         Any         |   Offline servers only  | Offline servers only |

<small>This is very summarized even with what is mentioned in the Log in guide.</small>
<br/><br/>

Microsoft has the absolute advantage since the only real limit is the [Cape](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cape).\
You also show your support for the creators, who have been updating the game for over 15 years and allowing you to play every version to this day.

## Can I use SKlauncher if I own Minecraft: Bedrock Edition?
You cannot play Minecraft: Bedrock Edition with SKlauncher since it is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher. But if you own Minecraft: Bedrock Edition for PC, you should be able to get Minecraft: Java Edition for free, which you can use with the launcher. Unfortunately, if you only own Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on console (XBOX, Playstation, etc.) or on mobile (iOS, Android) you'll have to buy the game seperately for PC. Refer to the [question below](#where-can-i-buy-the-game) for info on where to buy the game.

## Where can I buy the game?
- You can do it from the [Official Site](https://www.minecraft.net/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc) and [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/apps/9nxp44l49shj) as permanent options (one-time payment).
- You also have the option of the [Xbox Game Pass for PC](https://www.xbox.com/games/store/game-pass-para-pc/cfq7ttc0kgq8) (pay per month) or simply the [Free Trial](https://www.minecraft.net/free-trial) (temporary).

:::note

Don't forget to always check that you're buying Minecraft: Java Edition.\
However, if it hasn't changed, you might see that you're buying Minecraft: Java Edition and Minecraft: Bedrock Edition at the same time.

:::

:::danger

Key selling websites may be an option, but you should be careful from whom you're buying and pray that the key isn't stolen.\
The latter is a bad thing for both: the creator loses money in analyzing that it's indeed stolen and then your game is taken away from you.

:::

## Is SKlauncher piracy?
Since the previous question is about buying the game you'll have this logical question.

SKlauncher is perfectly legal since all the files come from the official Mojang servers, servers that allow public access and their files are even the ones that have the launch parameters to use.\
Nothing is re-hosted, much less cracked. Just as the server can change the [online-mode](/troubleshooting/game-related#failed-to-login-invalid-session), the client can enable/disable the demo mode.

This is how everything is coded, literally the existence of third party launchers is to make things easier (like installing Mod Loaders, Mods, Modpacks, etc.) since you can literally start everything with just a simple .bat / .sh file.

## Is SKlauncher a virus?
Visit [this](/virus) link for more information, since this is a very complex question to be simplified and answered in simple terms.\
If you want something short: No! SKlauncher never had, doesn't have and never will have viruses!

## Is SKlauncher open source?
Not at the moment, but there are plans for it to be in the future. However the code code isn't obfuscated, so you could decompile it and verify everything for yourself.

> We would like to go open-source in 2024, but it's not so simple. Many parts of the launcher is not ready for foss, but I would love to make it foss. When I started this project I never intended it to be open-source as you need some sacrifices for it, and back then most of the projects weren't open-source, and a lot still isn't. Just look for paid plugins on spigot, it's closed source and even obfuscated. Does sticking a price makes it safe? No. But yes, java is fully decompilable, and you can read the code pretty close to the original (unless it's obfuscated), there are some launchers that are open-source, there are launchers that are closed source, and bruh, there are launchers that are open source where the source is obfuscated, so it's not really open source. But here you can read the source, while the licenses doesn't allow you to just clone the launcher for your needs. I wouldn't like to see my work where someone just changed it's name and logo, but's thats the price of being open source\

PS: Open source doesn't equal security. Not only the platform (GitHub for example) won't warn you "Hey, there's something dangerous here!" but you end up with a false security believing "someone else already checked it".

## Can I force the Demo mode?
Yes, just run the launcher with `--demo` (if you have skin/cape, it should still be visible).

## Can I use clients, mods, resource packs, shaders, etc. in SKlauncher?
Yes, everything that works for *Minecraft Launcher* should work in *SKlauncher*.

The only difference may be the way to install. For example:\
\- SKlauncher 3.2.x: You can install the Mod Loader from the "Installations Manager" and even install Modpacks. Something that in Minecraft Launcher should be done manually.\
\- SKlauncher 3.3.x *(Not released yet)*: In addition to the above, you can add Mods, Resource Packs, Shaders and Maps!

:::info

Some Clients and maybe Mods may require you to enable *Compatibility Mode* (which disables the SKlauncher skin system).

And although the [Modding](/category/modding) guide tells you how to install the Mod Loaders, the other things you should search on [Google](https://www.google.com/) / [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). But I'll give you some little tips:
- You will find your true game folder by right clicking on the installation you want to play and then click on "Open installation directory" (this is in case you've a [Game Directory](#how-does-game-directory-work) defined).
- Just as the launcher allows you to download from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/), you can access both sites to search for the Mods, Resource Packs, Shaders, etc. you're looking for.
- If the guide you're following is for Minecraft Launcher (everything is done manually) you're fine. If it's for another launcher than SKlauncher it might not work.

:::

## How does Game Directory work?
If you read about [--workDir](#can-i-install-sklauncher-in-another-folder) you will see that the concept in short is "*I want my .minecraft to actually be in a different place*".\
But what about installations (or instances if you prefer that name) of the game? What if you want to have your options, worlds, mods, etc. from Release 1.8 separated from Release 1.16.5? That's where setting up a Game Directory comes into play.

- If the Game Directory isn't set...
    - All your worlds, options, mods, etc. are in the same place.
- If the Game Directory is set (reference image below)...
    - Most files are still downloaded to your .minecraft, you will even have to install the Mod Loader (Forge / Fabric / Others) there.
    - The invididual mods (OptiFine / Sodium / Others), your options, your worlds, your game / crash logs, etc. will be separate.

![Reference image](/img/faq/launcher-related/gamedir.png)

:::tip

As shown in the reference image above, the Game Directory for the Vanilla 1.17.1 installation is set to `"%APPDATA%\.minecraft\skprofiles\Vanilla 1.17.1"` while the one for the Fabric 1.17.1 installation is set to `"%APPDATA%\.minecraft\skprofiles\Fabric 1.17.1"`.

These folders (skprofiles, Vanilla 1.17.1 and Fabric 1.17.1) were created manually, so you could create them as "Game-Instances", "Custom" and "Example". The only important thing is NOT to put them in game folders (like versions folder).

:::note

If you right click on the installation you want to play and then click on "Open installation directory", the folder of your Game Directory will open.

:::

## Can I use a different Java for the game?
Of course you can! Edit the installation you want to play with a different Java and in the *More Options* section search for *Java Executable*, click on the folder icon and you will be able to find your *javaw.exe* (Windows) or *java* (Linux / macOS) that you want to use (it can be from Temurin, Liberica or other).\
If you want to go back to *Use bundled Java runtime*, just delete the entire path you set and let the game decide.

:::tip

Don't install one Java for SKlauncher and another Java for the game! Use the extractable version of Java (usually .zip for Windows and .tar.gz for Linux and macOS).\
This way you can try any Java you want without any problems, because maybe the Java that doesn't allow you to start SKlauncher is the Java that gives you more performance / stability if you use it in the game.

:::

## How to uninstall SKlauncher?
Read [this](#where-is-sklauncher-installed) question and delete the mentioned files/folders that are from SKlauncher and you're done.\
Or also the .minecraft folder, but that's deleting the whole game (including your worlds, mods and resource packs) and not just SKlauncher.

If your idea is to delete absolutely everything, also uninstall Java.\
And after all that restart the PC, so you can say that you have "deleted all traces" of Java, SKlauncher and Minecraft: Java Edition.
