Before you start looking here, check the following pages first:

## Can I migrate my Other Launcher account to SKlauncher?
- Yes, just [make your SKlauncher account](/getting-started/register) and when it asks for a username you type the same username you had in *Other Launcher*.
  - Obviously it must be the same: going from *TheExample* to *theexample* isn't the same thing.
- You won't lose anything because the UUID will remain the same (unless that *Other Launcher* has a different UUID system).

## How do I put on a skin or cape?
- If you already have your own skin or cape, simply go to the [customization](https://skmedix.pl/settings/customization) view and upload them in the appropriate fields. Remember to pay attention to the *Slim* field, which can affect the appearance of your skin.
- In case you are still looking for a skin or cape, we recommend using our [skins](https://skmedix.pl/skins) and [capes](https://skmedix.pl/capes) pages respectively, which contain thousands of skins and capes ready to use.

:::note

If you're using a Microsoft account, then you'll need to do it from the *[Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)* ([alternative](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/alternative)).\
But keep in mind the [skins priority](#will-other-players-be-able-to-see-my-skin-and-cape)!

## Is it possible to upload transparent skins?
Minecraft: Java Edition doesn't support transparent skins by default, so they will not be visible without the appropriate mods.\
SKlauncher itself doesn't include a mod for visibility of transparent skins, as we're not modifying the game. However, if you feel the need to do so, nothing prevents you from [finding a suitable mod](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-use-clients-mods-resource-packs-shaders-etc-in-sklauncher).

## Can I upload an animated cape?
As with the issue of transparent skins, SKlauncher doesn't modify the game itself. And this is necessary for animated skins to be seen in the game world.\
At the moment, we have no plans to change this. If you want to see an animated cape you will need to [find a suitable mod](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-use-clients-mods-resource-packs-shaders-etc-in-sklauncher).

## Will other players be able to see my skin and cape?
Yes! If your friends or other players on the server also use SKlauncher then you will all see your skins in the game.\
Playing with our launcher is a prerequisite. If you've changed your skin and your fellow players don't see it, check if it's visible in your account settings on our website. Also try restarting the game along with the launcher.

:::info

No matter if you're using a Microsoft or Offline account, the priority of the skins/capes is the following:\
1\. SKlauncher\
2\. Microsoft\
3\. Dedicated server (some mod or plugin, like SkinsRestorer)
