## Common questions
Some users may have some questions before or after downloading, we'll see the main ones here:

### Can I use the .jar in Windows?
Of course!

### What's the difference between all the download options?
On Windows, you have 3 options: the Setup, .jar and .exe\
The Windows Setup is a new addition and is the recommended way to install the launcher. With the setup, no other installations are necessary. The setup downloads all the required files including the JRE and JavaFX for you. It is also [open source](https://github.com/sklauncher/installer).\
The .jar requires a JRE (Eclipse Adoptium 21 recommended) to run. It's also **portable**, meaning it can be run from any directory.\
The portable .exe is the .jar converted to .exe using Exe4j, so the only difference is that the .exe will give you an error message if you don't have Java installed/updated (and a nice icon).\
It can be said that it's to simplify things for Windows users.

On macOS, you also have 3 options: the .dmg, .app and .jar\
The .dmg and the .app are mostly the same thing and both require Java to work. The .dmg requires you to drag it into the Applications folder to work.\
The .jar also needs Java to run.

On Linux you only have the option for a .jar download, which requires Java to run.\
Flatpak will be released in the future.

### Is it a virus?
Visit [this](/virus) link for more information, since this is a very complex question to be simplified and answered in simple terms.\
If you want something short: No! SKlauncher never had, doesn't have and never will have viruses!
