## Common questions
Some users may have some questions before or after downloading, we'll see the main ones here:

### Can I use the .jar in Windows?
Of course!

### What's the difference between .exe and .jar?
The .exe is the .jar converted to .exe using Exe4j, so the only difference is that the .exe will give you an error message if you don't have Java installed/updated (and a nice icon).\
It can be said that it's to simplify things for Windows users.

### Is it a virus?
Visit [this](/virus) link for more information, since this is a very complex question to be simplified and answered in simple terms.\
If you want something short: No! SKlauncher never had, don't have and never will have viruses!
