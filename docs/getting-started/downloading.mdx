To download and run SKlauncher, you will need to follow these simple steps:

## Downloading

    - If you are using macOS, download the .dmg file.
3. Follow the instructions to [install SKlauncher](/getting-started/install)

## Common questions
Some users may have some questions before or after downloading, we'll see the main ones here:

### What's the difference between all the download options?

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>
    - **Setup**: the recommended way to install the launcher. It includes everything needed, so no additional installations are required.
    - **.jar**: requires Java to run. It's **portable**, meaning it can be run from any directory.
    - **.exe** *(included in the .zip file only)*: the .jar converted to .exe using Exe4j. The only difference is that the .exe provides an error message if Java is missing or outdated (and has a nicer icon).\
                It can be said that it's to simplify things for Windows users when there was no Setup (so in the future it will no longer be available for download).

  <TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">
    - **.jar**: requires Java to run. It's **portable**, meaning it can be run from any directory.
    - **Flatpak**: will be released in the future.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">
    - **.dmg** and **.app**: both require Java to work. The .app inside the .dmg must be dragged into the Applications folder.
    - **.jar**: also requires Java to run. It's **portable**, meaning it can be run from any directory.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Is it a virus?
Visit [this](/virus) link for more information, since this is a very complex question to be simplified and answered in simple terms.\
If you want something short: No! SKlauncher never had, doesn't have and never will have viruses!

## Common issues

- Try in Incognito mode (Private / InPrivate).
- Try in another web browser like Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, etc.
