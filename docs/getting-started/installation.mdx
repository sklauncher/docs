To run SKlauncher you need to have Java installed on your computer. In this guide we will show you how to install Java and SKlauncher.

## Java Requirements
For a long time, SKlauncher required Java 8 with JavaFX, but this is no longer the case. Now you can use any version of Java above 11. We recommend using the LTS (Long-term support) version, which is currently Java 21.

:::danger

Support for Java 8 with JavaFX will be removed in the future. We recommend using Java 21.

:::

## Installing Java

### Java 21 (Recommended)

#### Windows
1. Go to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) and click on the **Latest LTS Release** button.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
3. In the *Custom Setup* screen, make sure to select the following options:
    - Add to PATH
    - Associate .jar
    - Set JAVA_HOME variable
    - JavaSoft (Oracle) registry key
4. Click **Next**, then **Install**.
5. Wait for the installation to finish, then click **Finish**.

#### Linux
Install Java 21 using your distribution's package manager. Here are instructions for some common distributions:

##### Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

##### Fedora:
```
sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk
```

##### Arch Linux:
```
sudo pacman -S jdk21-openjdk
```

### Java 8 with JavaFX

:::caution

Sometimes your Java 8 may be too old to run SKlauncher. In this case, you need to update it.

:::

If you can't use Java 21, you can use Java 8 with JavaFX. We recommend using either:
- [Oracle Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- [Liberica 8 Full JDK](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-8-lts)

## Running SKlauncher
You don't need to [register](/getting-started/register) to try it, but when you see the "log in" screen we recommend you read the [Log in](/getting-started/login) guide to avoid headaches.

### Windows
If you didn't skip the Custom Setup screen, you can now run SKlauncher.

### Linux
To run SKlauncher on Linux, use the following command in the Terminal:

```
java -jar SKlauncher.jar
```

Make sure you're in the directory containing the SKlauncher.jar\* file, or provide the full path to the file.

:::tip

You may need to give it execute permissions first by typing `chmod +x SKlauncher.jar` (and maybe `755` instead of `+x`).

:::

<small>\* - When downloading the name is in SKlauncher-version.jar format. Ideally, you should always rename it to SKlauncher in case you've to download it again (especially if you make a shortcut or script to launch it).</small>

## Common questions

### I have Java X, but the game requires Java Y, will it work?
Yes, it will work. SKlauncher downloads the game's version of Java, so you can use any version of Java on your computer. \*

<small>\* - And if you want to use another Java when playing (like using Java 21 when the game would use Java 17), you can do it! But the explanation is [here](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-use-a-different-java-for-the-game).</small>

### Why do I need Java 8 with JavaFX?
SKlauncher is built with JavaFX, which may not be included in Java 8 by default. So you need to install Java 8 with JavaFX or Java 21.

### Can I NOT install Java?
Yes, but you will need to understand 2 things:
1. You will need to use the extractable version of Java (usually .zip for Windows and .tar.gz for Linux and Mac OS).
2. You will need to run SKlauncher (.jar version) via commands (for example `java -jar SKlauncher.jar`).

And you will need to have a minimum of knowledge about understanding your working directory, relative/absolute paths, using "quotes" if that path has spaces in it (or some specific character), etc.

<small>
    For example, this is what it would be like to run SKlauncher via CMD commands in Windows when my working directory is the Downloads folder:\
    `"jdk-21.0.5+11\bin\java.exe" -jar SKlauncher.jar`
</small>

### Can I install SKlauncher in another folder?
Of course! But the full answer on how to do it is [here](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-install-sklauncher-in-another-folder).

## Common issues

:::tip

Did you already have Java before and you installed the one in the guide?\
Did you uninstalled every Java and you're about to install the one in the guide?

It may be a good idea to restart the PC.

:::

### I have Temurin 21 installed, but it still says that I don't have Java installed
In this situation you probably skipped the *Custom Setup* screen. To fix this, you need to reinstall Java 21,
and make sure to [follow the instructions](/getting-started/install#windows) in the *Custom Setup* screen.

### I have Liberica 8 installed, but it still says that I don't have Java 8 with JavaFX
In this situation you probably have Liberica 8 Standard Edition installed. To fix this, you need to install Liberica 8 Full JDK.
You need to download it from [here](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-8-lts), but make sure to select **Full JDK**.
