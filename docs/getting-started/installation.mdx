## Windows Setup
If you got the setup (installer) for Windows, you only have to run the installer and follow the installation steps in the setup.\
If you're already familiar with Windows setup files then this should be simple.

The installation steps within the installer are:
1. Select Start Menu Folder: This is optional, you have the option to choose a different path. This only changes the path of the shortcuts, not the actual launcher.
2. Ready To Install: Click on Install, unless you want to change your shorcut path, which in that case, click on Back.
3. Installing SKlauncher: On this screen you only have to wait for the install to finish, once it's done, you'll go to the last step.
4. Completing the SKlauncher 3.2 Setup Wizard: Once you're here, just click on Finish.

## Java Requirements
For a long time, SKlauncher required Java 8 with JavaFX, but this is no longer the case. Now you can use the latest LTS (Long-term support), which is currently Java 21.

:::danger

Support for Java 8 with JavaFX will be removed in the future. We recommend using Java 21.\
Java is only necessary if you are going to use the portable .exe, .jar, .dmg or .app files (in case of [Windows Setup](#windows-setup), it's already included and you don't have to do anything).

## Installing Java

### Java 21 (Recommended)

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

  <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

    1. Go to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) and click on the **Latest LTS Release** button.
    2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.
    3. In the *Custom Setup* screen, make sure to select the following options:
        - Add to PATH
        - Associate .jar
        - Set JAVA_HOME variable
        - JavaSoft (Oracle) registry key
    4. Click **Next**, then **Install**.
    5. Wait for the installation to finish, then click **Finish**.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

    There are many different Distros, so you may want to visit the [Adoptium guide](https://adoptium.net/installation/) or search on [Google](https://www.google.com/).

    :::info

    1. If when installing it tells you that it did not find the package, it means that you must [add it](https://adoptium.net/installation/linux/).
    2. If you don't want to use `sudo` for every command that requires it, switch to *root* using `sudo -i`
        - Only do this to add, update and install the package!

    :::

    1. Open your Terminal and then update the package list according to your OS:
        - Debian or Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get update`
        - CentOS/RHEL/Fedora: `sudo yum update`
        - openSUSE/SLES: `sudo zypper refresh`
    2. Install Java 21 according to your OS:
        - Debian or Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install temurin-21-jdk`
        - CentOS/RHEL/Fedora: `sudo yum install temurin-21-jdk`
        - openSUSE/SLES: `sudo zypper install temurin-21-jdk`
    3. If everything went well, you can now try this command `java -version` and get Java 21 (as well as other things).

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

    1. Go to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) and click on the **Latest LTS Release** button.

## Running SKlauncher
You don't need to [register](/getting-started/register) to try it, but when you see the "log in" screen we recommend you read the [Log in](/getting-started/login) guide to avoid headaches.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">

  <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

    - Setup case:
        - A shortcut has been created on your desktop named SKlauncher, so just start it.
    - Other cases:
        - If you didn't skip the Custom Setup screen, you can run the SKlauncher file you downloaded.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

    To run SKlauncher, use the following command in the Terminal:

    ```
    java -jar SKlauncher.jar
    ```

    Make sure you're in the directory containing the SKlauncher.jar\* file, or provide the full path to the file.

    :::tip

    You may need to give it execute permissions first by typing `chmod +x SKlauncher.jar` (and maybe `755` instead of `+x`).

    :::

    <small>\* - When downloading the name is in SKlauncher-version.jar format. Ideally, you should always rename it to SKlauncher in case you've to download it again (especially if you make a shortcut or script to launch it).</small>

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

    - .dmg and .app case:
        - You should see SKlauncher in your Launchpad, so you start it from there.
    - Other cases:
    	- Double click SKlauncher.jar to run it.
        - Use the following command in the Terminal: `java -jar SKlauncher.jar`
            - Make sure you're in the directory containing the SKlauncher.jar\* file, or provide the full path to the file.

## Common questions

### What is the difference between Setup and Portable?
Before Setup existed, here's what you had to do in a nutshell:
- Download and Install Java
- Download and Start SKlauncher (exe / jar)

Now with the Setup, the same thing still happens but:
- Java is downloaded (not installed)
- JavaFX is downloaded (not installed)
- It creates a shortcut, which if you check it says something like: `%APPDATA%\sklauncher\jre\bin\javaw.exe -Xmx512M -jar %APPDATA%\sklauncher\SKlauncher.jar`

Is it a virus?
- Since Setup is [open source](<https://github.com/sklauncher/installer>) and compiled from the same GitHub Actions, everything the documentation says [about it](/virus) still applies in the same way.
- Did you know that for a simple change like [this](https://github.com/sklauncher/installer/commit/9c25564cfcc51aae11965ffc50bab7a52547cae3), VirusTotal went from 6 to 2 detections? So please, let's not have this talk every time the .exe (in this case Setup) is updated.

### I have Java X, but the game requires Java Y, will it work?
Yes, it will work. SKlauncher downloads the game's version of Java, so you can use any version of Java on your computer. \*

<small>\* - And if you want to use another Java when playing (like using Java 21 when the game would use Java 17), you can do it! But the explanation is [here](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-use-a-different-java-for-the-game).</small>

### Why do I need Java 8 with JavaFX?
SKlauncher is built with JavaFX, which may not be included in Java 8 by default. So you need to install Java 8 with JavaFX or Java 21.

### Can I NOT install Java?
Yes, but this requires:
1. Using a portable Java distribution:
    - Windows: .zip format
    - Linux / macOS: .tar.gz format
2. Running SKlauncher via command line: `java -jar SKlauncher.jar`

:::note

This approach requires basic knowledge of:
- Working directories.
- Relative / absolute paths.
- Using "quotes" for paths with spaces.

<small>
    For example, this is what it would be like to run SKlauncher via CMD commands in Windows when my working directory is the Downloads folder:\
    `"jdk-21.0.5+11\bin\java.exe" -jar SKlauncher.jar`
</small>

:::

### Can I install SKlauncher in another folder?
Of course! But the full answer on how to do it is [here](/faq/launcher-related#can-i-install-sklauncher-in-another-folder).

## Common issues

:::tip

Did you already have Java before and you installed the one in the guide?\
Did you uninstall every Java you had and are about to install the one in the guide?

It may be a good idea to restart the PC.

:::

### I have Temurin 21 installed, but it still says that I don't have Java installed
In this situation you probably skipped the *Custom Setup* screen. To fix this, you need to reinstall Java 21, and make sure to [follow the instructions](#java-21-recommended) (Windows tab) in the *Custom Setup* screen.

### I have Liberica 8 installed, but it still says that I don't have Java 8 with JavaFX
In this situation you probably have Liberica 8 Standard Edition installed. To fix this, you need to install Liberica 8 Full JDK.
You need to download it from [here](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-8-lts), but make sure to select **Full JDK**.
