:::info

This is totally *optional*, **you don't need to create an account** to try SKlauncher as you will read in the [Log in](/getting-started/login) guide.\
But if your idea is to **change the skin and cape**, then yes: *you need to create an account*.

:::

1. Go to [SKlauncher](https://skmedix.pl/) and click [Sign in](https://skmedix.pl/login).
2. If you want to create an account using...
    - Discord: click *Login with Discord* and follow the instructions.
    - Email: click *[Register now](https://skmedix.pl/register)* and follow the instructions.

:::warning

Don't lose access to your Discord / Email or you'll lose your account if you forget your password!\
<small>If you don't lose anything and forget your password, [it's recoverable](/troubleshooting/web-related#i-forgot-my-password).</small>

:::

3. Done, now you have an SKlauncher account. But now you're missing the profile that will define your username\* (the in-game name) and with it the possibility to modify the skin and cape.\
So follow the instructions (assuming you're on the [Customization](https://skmedix.pl/settings/customization) page) so you can finish everything to finally [Log in](/getting-started/login) to the launcher.

<small>\* - If it already exists in SKlauncher you won't be able to use it, but some recommend to check that it doesn't exist in Microsoft either with [NameMC](https://namemc.com/) / [MCChecker](https://mcchecker.net/)</small>
