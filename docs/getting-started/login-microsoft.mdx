:::info

This option is *only for users* who have *Minecraft: Java Edition* **[purchased](/faq/launcher-related#where-can-i-buy-the-game)**.\
In addition those users **had to create an user** when using *[Minecraft Launcher](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download)* ([alternative](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/alternative)) at *least once*.

## Login
1. Run SKlauncher and click the "Login with Microsoft" button.
2. Your default browser will open an official Microsoft login page for you to sign in with your account (make sure it's the one that has Minecraft: Java Edition purchased).
3. In a moment it will ask you if you want to allow an app (ReLogin) and you must do it.
4. When the whole process is finished, you will be redirected to a local page saying that you can now close your browser (do it).
5. If everything is ok, you will see that you are logged in to SKlauncher with your Microsoft account.

## Common questions

### What is ReLogin, is it dangerous?
It's a generic Microsoft Azure application where you do the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow to get the access token so you can play (like any launcher would do....in a nutshell and in simple terms).

> On 30th August 2024 for a few hours we switched from using *ReLogin* to *Auth Me for Minecraft*. In the end it was switched back to ReLogin because it wasn't a necessary change.\
> This is noted in case you see that App when you visit [Microsoft - Manage applications](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage).

So no, it's not dangerous. Obviously don't push your luck and publish your access token or your refresh token.\
If you think you've leaked any, you can always manually invalidate them:\
\- The refresh token when you remove ReLogin.\
\- The access token when you change your Microsoft password.

### What data does SKlauncher store about my Microsoft account?
From the Launcher: Google Analytics data.\
About your Microsoft account: Absolutely nothing.

## Common issues

### Couldn't log in / Profile not found
Read the error message and do what it says, but if that doesn't help you can always [ask for help in Discord](https://skmedix.pl/discord) explaining the problem (and sending the log by clicking on <u>Open Log</u>).\
This is assuming that the [Xbox Live service](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) isn't down and that you followed the info at the top of this page (if both are ok, you can try restarting the launcher and try again).
