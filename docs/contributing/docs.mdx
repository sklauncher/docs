title: Conributing to the Documentation
---
These docs are still a work in progess. Thank you for considering contibuting to these docs! Any contribution is always appreciated.

## How to get started
All you need is a GitHub account to contribute to the docs, and if you don't have one, you can create one for free [here](https://github.com/signup).
Next you can navigate to [SKlauncher's docs repository](https://github.com/sklauncher/docs) and fork it.
These docs use **Markdown**, a lightweight markup language. If you don't know where to start with Markdown, there are plenty of resources online to help you get started such as [this one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
<!-- 
If there's any better guide for Markdown please replace the link above with that.

## How to edit
You can now navigate to your forked repository and then you can edit any of the pages by opening the file you want to edit such as `/docs/contributing/translations.mdx` and clicking 'Edit file' at the top right corner. You can now make any changes you believe are improvements on the original document. After you made the changes you can press 'Commit changes...' and open a [pull request](#how-to-open-a-pull-request).

## How to add a new document
To add a new document, you navigate to your forked repository, open the `docs` folder, and find the correct folder to place your new file in, and click 'Add file', and name it `*filename*.mdx`. It should be the `.mdx` format (Markdown). You can now add information to the document, however, make sure the first 3 lines are; \

```
---
title: <your title>
---
```

Once you're done, you can commit the changes and open a [pull request.](#how-to-open-a-pull-request)

## How to open a pull request
If you want to propose your changes so they could get reviewed and hopefully implemented in the actual docs, you will have to do this step.
Navigate to the [SKlauncher documentation repository](https://github.com/sklauncher/docs) and click on the **Pull requests** tab.
Then click on the **New pull request** button in the top right corner. You will be redirected to a page where you can
choose the branch you want to merge your changes into. Choose `main` as a base, and your branch as a compare. Then add
a title and a description to your pull request and click on the **Create pull request** button.
