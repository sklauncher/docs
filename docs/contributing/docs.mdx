Thank you for considering contributing to these docs! Any help is greatly appreciated!

## What <span className="text--danger">NOT</span> to do when writing docs
* Do not just copy and paste text generated by AI. We will notice that.
* Do not make low effort/quality contributions to docs. By low effort/quality we mean:
    - paraphrasing if it's not making the text easier to understand or read.
    - changing the order of sentences without improving readability.
    - changing just one word and calling it a day.
    - making the text longer by adding unnecessary words or phrases.
* Do not change the markup language used by the wiki. Use [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), and if something you want to do is not supported by it, use [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements).

Of course if you find a typo, fix it and create a pull request, it will get merged. This is not considered a low effort/low quality contribution.

## How to get started
All you need is a GitHub account, and if you don't have one, you can create one for free [here](https://github.com/signup). Next you must [fork SKlauncher's docs repository](https://github.com/sklauncher/docs/fork).\
Our docs use **Markdown** for formatting, a lightweight markup language. If you don't know where to start with Markdown, there are plenty of resources online to help you get started such as [this one](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

## How to edit
You can now navigate to your forked repository and edit any of the pages.
1. Open the file you want to edit such as `/docs/contributing/docs.mdx`.
    - [Or create a new one.](#how-to-add-a-new-document)
2. Click a button with a **pencil icon** in it at the top right corner.
3. Make your changes to the file.
4. Once you are done, press 'Commit changes...' and open a [pull request](#how-to-open-a-pull-request).

## How to add a new document
To add a new document, you...

1. Navigate to your forked repository and open the correct folder to place your new file in.
2. Click the **button with a plus icon in it**, then from a drop down menu select **Create new file**.
3. Name the file to reflect its contents, such as `downloading.mdx`. It must be in `.mdx` format.

You can now add information to the document, however, make sure the first 3 lines are:
```
---
title: <your title>
---
```

Once you are done, you can commit the changes and open a [pull request](#how-to-open-a-pull-request).

## How to open a pull request
Once you are done with your changes, you must submit them to us for review. This is what "pull requests" are for. Please note that the review process may take some time as we do this in our spare time.

1. Navigate to the [pull requests tab](https://github.com/sklauncher/docs/pulls) in the SKlauncher documentation repository.
2. Click the **New pull request** button in the top right corner.
3. You will be redirected to a page where you can choose the branch you want to merge your changes into. Choose `main` as a base, and your branch as a compare.
4. Add a title and a description to your pull request and click the **Create pull request** button.

You are all set! Stay tuned for potential change requests, as you may need to change something before we merge your changes.
