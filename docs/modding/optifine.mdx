To install OptiFine, you will need to follow these simple steps:

## Downloading OptiFine
1. Head over to the **[OptiFine website](https://optifine.net)**.
2. Look for OptiFine for your Minecraft version.
3. Once you've found it, click on the **(Mirror)** link beside the OptiFine version you want to download.
4. Click the **Download** button.

## Installing OptiFine
There are two ways to install OptiFine.

* First one is to run the .jar file you downloaded in the previous steps. Go with this one **if you don't intend to use OptiFine alongside other mods**.
* Second one is to put the OptiFine .jar file to the mods folder. This way **you can use OptiFine with other mods**. You will need [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net) for this to work. Fabric **is not officially supported**.

### Using an installer
Before following these steps, **make sure you have run the version of Minecraft for which you want to install OptiFine at least once**.
1. Run the .jar file you downloaded.
2. Click **Install**.
3. Restart SKlauncher.
4. Select **OptiFine** profile.
5. Done!

### Using Forge
1. Go to the **Installations Manager** and create a new installation.
2. In the version chooser select **Forge** and choose desired Minecraft version.
3. Customize the installation to your liking and save it.
4. Right click on a newly created installation and click on **Open Installation Directory** from the context menu.
5. The file manager window should now open at a game directory. Create a new folder with a name `mods` there.
6. Drag and drop OptiFine .jar file you downloaded earlier into that folder.
7. Done!

### OptiFine shaders
OptiFine can be used to play with shaders! Once you've finished installing OptiFine and wish to use shaders, refer to [this guide](/docs/modding/shaders.mdx/#installing-optifine-shaders) for instructions.

## Using OptiFine with Fabric
You can do so by installing **[OptiFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric)** mod, 
but it's **<span className="text--danger">not recommended</span>** for compatibility reasons. Even the author of this mod suggests using alternatives to Optifine such as **[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)**. 
It serves the same purpose as OptiFine, works natively with Fabric and reportedly gives even better performance. Sodium however doesn't have shaders support built in. But you can use the **[Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/Iris)** mod for that. 
For a more detailed guide on installing shaders using Sodium + Iris, refer to [this guide.](/docs/modding/shaders.mdx/#installing-shaders-through-iris)

## Common questions
### Why can't it be installed automatically?
If you look closely, when you download OptiFine you go through advertising. Without advertising it's even more money sp614x (creator of OptiFine) itself has to put in to maintain everything.\
Now if we look at the website...

> Can I include OptiFine in my modpack?\
> Generally no, unless you have an explicit permission from us.\

So much less he wants it to be integrated into a launcher without permission and SKlauncher respects his decision.
