Minecraft: Java Edition allows you to modify the game in different ways:\
There are **native modifications**, such as **resource packs** and **data packs**, which *do not require additional tools* to work.\
On the other hand, there are also **external modifications** that need a **Mod Loader** such as *Forge or Fabric* to install and run correctly.
