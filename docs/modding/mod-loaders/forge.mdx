Always download mods from trusted sources, otherwise they may cause harm to your operating system.

Thanks to SKlauncher, installing Forge is a really quick and simple process. Here's what you will need to do to install it:

1. Open **SKlauncher**.
2. Go to the **Installations Manager** tab in the left menu.
3. Click the **New Installation** button.
4. In the **Create new installation** window:
	- Give your installation a name (e.g., "Forge 1.21.1").
	- From the list of version types select **Forge**.
	- Choose your desired Minecraft and Forge Loader versions.
5. (Optional) Customize other settings if desired:
	- Select (or add custom) an Icon for your new installation
	- Change the game directory.
	- Under **More Options** dropdown menu:
		- Adjust memory allocation
		- Modify Java arguments
		- Modify launcher visibility
6. Click **Save** to create the new Forge installation.

Alternatively, you can install Forge manually by downloading the Forge installer from [the official Forge website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/) and then running it and following the installation steps. A Forge installation will now appear in SKlauncher; you may need to restart the launcher if it doesn't appear immediately.

## Launching Forge
1. Return to the main SKlauncher window.
2. In the sidebar, select your newly created Forge installation.
3. Click "Play" to launch Minecraft with Forge.

You're now ready to use Forge mods! Simply download your preferred mods and place them in the 'mods' folder located in the .minecraft folder; and if there isn't one, you may need to create it.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, make sure Forge and the mods you have installed are compatible with your Minecraft version.
- Some mods may require additional dependencies. Always read the mod's documentation for specific installation instructions.
- If a mod isn't working, check the game's log for any error messages that might provide more information.
