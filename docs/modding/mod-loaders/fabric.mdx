## Installing Fabric

Thanks to SKlauncher, installing Fabric is a really quick and simple process. Here's what you will need to do to install it:

1. Open **SKlauncher**.
2. Click on the **Installations Manager** tab in the left menu.
3. Click the **New Installation** button.
4. In the **Create new installation** window:
	- Give your installation a name (e.g., "Fabric 1.21.1").
	- From the list of version types select **Fabric**.
	- Choose your desired Minecraft and Fabric Loader versions.
5. (Optional) Customize other settings if desired:
	- Select (or add custom) an Icon for your new installation
	- Change the game directory.
	- Under **More Options** dropdown menu:
		- Adjust memory allocation
		- Modify Java arguments
		- Modify launcher visibility
6. Click **Save** to create the new Fabric installation.

Alternatively, you can install Fabric manually by downloading the Fabric installer from [the official Fabric website](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer) and then running it and following the installation steps. A Fabric installation will now appear in SKlauncher; you may need to restart the launcher if it doesn't appear immediately.

## Installing Fabric API

Fabric API is essential for many Fabric mods. You can get it from either CurseForge or Modrinth.

1. Download Fabric API from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api/versions) or [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files).
2. Find the Fabric API version that matches your Minecraft and Fabric Loader version.
3. Download the .jar file.
4. Open your **mods** folder.
	- Windows: `%appdata%\.minecraft\mods\`
	- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/`
	- Linux: `~/.minecraft/mods/`
	- If the 'mods' folder doesn't exist, create it.
5. Place the downloaded file into the **mods** folder.

## Launching Fabric
1. Return to the main SKlauncher window.
2. In the sidebar, select your newly created Fabric installation.
3. Click "Play" to launch Minecraft with Fabric.

You're now ready to use Fabric mods! Simply download your preferred mods and place them in the 'mods' folder located in the .minecraft folder; and if there isn't one, you may need to create it.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, make sure Fabric, Fabric API and the mods you have installed are compatible with your Minecraft version.
- Some mods may require additional dependencies. Always read the mod's documentation for specific installation instructions.
- If a mod isn't working, check the game's log for any error messages that might provide more information.
