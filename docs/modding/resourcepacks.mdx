:::danger

Always download mods/resourcepacks from trusted sources, otherwise they may cause harm to your operating system.

Resource packs are a type of Minecraft mod that primarily changes textures, GUI, etc. These can be installed in Vanilla Minecraft, so 
no mod loader is necessary.

### Installing Resource Packs
1. Installing Resource Packs is simple, to get started, download your Resource Pack, which should be in the .ZIP format.

On macOS, it may be downloaded as a folder, in that case, compress it into a .ZIP file.

2. Find your `resourcepacks` folder located in your Minecraft folder.

On Windows this is `%AppData%/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
On macOS this is `~/Library/Application Support/Minecraft/resourcepacks`
On GNU/Linux this is `~/Minecraft/resourcepacks`

3. You can now drag and drop the resourcepack(s) you downloaded into the `resourcepacks` folder.
4. To apply your resource packs, launch the game and go to Options > Resource Packs and selecting your resource pack by moving it 
from the **Available** section to the **Selected** section.

You're now done! If you followed the instructions correctly your resource packs should work.
