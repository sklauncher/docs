Always download resource packs from trusted sources, otherwise they may cause harm to your operating system.

Resource packs are a type of Minecraft mod that primarily changes textures, GUI, etc. These can be installed in Vanilla Minecraft, so
no mod loader is necessary.

### Installing Resource Packs
1. Installing Resource Packs is simple, to get started, download your Resource Pack, which should be in the .zip format.\
On macOS, it may be downloaded as a folder, and in that case, simply compress the folder.

2. Find your `resourcepacks` folder located in your Minecraft\* folder.
    - On Windows this is `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\resourcepacks`
    - On Linux this is `~/.minecraft/resourcepacks`
    - On macOS this is `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/resourcepacks`

    <small>\* - If you modified your [game directory](/faq/launcher-related#how-does-game-directory-work), then you should look for `resourcepacks` folder in that location.</small>

3. You can now drag and drop the resourcepack(s) you downloaded into the `resourcepacks` folder.
4. To apply your resource packs, launch the game and go to Options > Resource Packs and selecting your resource pack by moving it
from the **Available** section to the **Selected** section.

You're now done! If you followed the instructions correctly your resource packs should work.
