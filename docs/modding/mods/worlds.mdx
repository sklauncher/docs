Always download worlds from trusted sources; otherwise, they may cause harm to your operating system.

:::note
This guide covers installing Minecraft worlds, specifically for Minecraft: Java Edition (which SKlauncher uses) but it should be noted that Minecraft worlds downloaded from the internet may come in different formats.\
Minecraft: Java Edition worlds are usually downloaded as a `.zip` file, while Minecraft: Bedrock Edition world files are usually downloaded as a `.mcworld` file.\
Also verify that the world you downloaded is for the correct version of Minecraft you'd want it to be in. Worlds on newer versions won't work on older clients (i.e. 1.21 worlds won't work on 1.14). For older worlds on newer clients, it should generally work fine, but extremely old worlds won't work.

## Downloading & Installing Worlds
1. Verify that the file you downloaded/received is a `.zip` file.
    - Safari on macOS might sometimes download `.zip` files as a folder, and in that case, you don't have to worry about this because you'll need it to be and extracted folder anyways.
2. **Unzip** it to the saves directory, which contains all your worlds.
   - On Windows, it's `%AppData%/.minecraft/saves`*
   - On macOS, it's `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves`*
   - On GNU/Linux it's `~/.minecraft/saves`*
3. Verify that the folder structure is correct (Optional but recommended)\
The unzipped folder must contain its own `data`, `poi`, and `region` folders.\
These folders should be directly under the unzipped folder; for example it should be;
```
World(.zip)
├── level.dat
├── region/
├── data/
├── poi/
└── (other files)
```
and **NOT;**
```
World(.zip)
└── World/
    ├── level.dat
    ├── region/
    ├── data/
    └── poi/
```

<small>\* - If you modified your [game directory](/faq/launcher-related#how-does-game-directory-work), then you should look for the `saves` folder in that location.</small>

4. You can now launch the game and select the world through the main menu > Singleplayer.
