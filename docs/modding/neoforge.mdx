Always download mods from trusted sources, otherwise they may cause harm to your operating system.

Thanks to SKlauncher, installing NeoForge is a really quick and simple process. Here's what you will need to do to install it:

1. Open **SKlauncher**.
2. Go to the **Installations Manager** tab in the left menu.
3. Click the **New Installation** button.
4. In the **Create new installation** window:
	- Give your installation a name (e.g., "NeoForge 1.21.1").
	- From the list of version types select **NeoForge**.
	- Choose your desired Minecraft and NeoForge Loader versions.
5. (Optional) Customize other settings if desired:
	- Select (or add custom) an Icon for your new installation
	- Change the game directory.
	- Under **More Options** dropdown menu:
		- Adjust memory allocation
		- Modify Java arguments
		- Modify launcher visibility
6. Click **Save** to create the new NeoForge installation.

Alternatively, you can install NeoForge manually by downloading the NeoForge installer from [the official NeoForged website](https://neoforged.net/) and then running it and following the installation steps. A NeoForge installation will now appear in SKlauncher; you may need to restart the launcher if it doesn't appear immediately.

## Launching NeoForge
1. Return to the main SKlauncher window.
2. In the sidebar, select your newly created NeoForge installation.
3. Click "Play" to launch Minecraft with NeoForge.

You're now ready to use NeoForge mods! Simply download your preferred mods and place them in the 'mods' folder located in the .minecraft folder; and if there isn't one, you may need to create it.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any issues, make sure NeoForge and the mods you have installed are compatible with your Minecraft version.
- Some mods may require additional dependencies. Always read the mod's documentation for specific installation instructions.
- If a mod isn't working, check the game's log for any error messages that might provide more information.
